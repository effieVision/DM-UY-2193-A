### Homework

Go through the process of creating a repo for your first assignment. Set it up to be hosted and viewable via Github Pages (`http://yourUserName.github.io/YourAssignmentRepo/`)

[Email](mailto:effie.vision@gmail.com) me the link to that repo.

When working in Terminal:

* **Remember:** `rm -rf` will delete files without confirming, so be careful that you are targeting the right files to delete.

* To explore more Terminal commands, search the internet for a "Terminal cheatsheet"

* Use `man <command>` to view the manual of any given command directly in Terminal.

* One fun one: [Play the Terminus Game](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html)
