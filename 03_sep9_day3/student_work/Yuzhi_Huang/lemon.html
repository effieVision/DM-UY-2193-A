                                  How I wish it were only a dream     Even now I still dream of you

                          I brush the dust off from old memories                  Like returning home to retrieve a forgotten item

                              In the end it was <b>you</b> <!--bold-->who taught me that     Some hapinesses can't be <del>reclaimed</del>  <!--crossed off-->

                        My dark, hidden past I dared not speak of      Without you, they would have remained forever <b>dark</b>

                                I know there is no way            I could ever hurt        More than I do now

                        Even the sadness from that day   Even the pain from that day      I loved it all, together with you

                                          The bitter scent of <b>lemons</b> remains embedded in my heart

                                                    Can't make my way home 'til the rain lets up

                                                            Even now you remain my light
