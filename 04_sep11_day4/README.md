  * A DOCTYPE tag

  * An html tag

  * A head

  * A body

  * In the body, add a large heading or image with the name or branding of your restaurant.

  * Below this large heading, add a smaller, sub-heading of the restaurant's slogan, or tells the user a bold statement about this restaurant

  * Include *sensational* paragraph text that tells a fictional 3-4 sentence story about this restaurant.

  * Add an *even more sensational* image of a food item that this restaurant sells.

  * Somewhere on the page, include a link to an external website. Bonus: Embed that link in the image.

#### Deliverable:

  * Correctly save and push your work back up to GitHub, and set the repo to be visible via Github Pages (yourUserName.github.io/restaurant-web)
